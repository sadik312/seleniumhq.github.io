**Selenium Community Live - Episode 1**

Collaboration, communication and community are the force behind the success of the Selenium Project in open source for last twenty years.
Jason Huggins and Simon Stewart with their respective projects Selenium and WebDriver collaborated and brought together Selenium WebDriver.
Eventually WebDriver became a W3C standard for browser automation, and Jim Evans and Manoj Kumar in the first episode of Selenium Community Live
discuss all about Selenium, and making of the WebDriver standard. They shed light on the process and people behind building these specifications.
They also spoke about various browser vendors and browser automation projects coming together to collaborate on making the next standard in browser automation
WebDriver Bi-Di. The Selenium project extend thanks to both Jim and Manoj for commemorating the first episode for community.
